                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>Cocoa powder painting is when cocoa powder is dissolved with hot water and turned to liquid that can be used to paint on 
                        <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/types-of-paper/" target="_blank">hot-press, cold-press, or rough paper</a> with brushes. Cocoa powder painting is similar to watercolor painting. The major differences are 
                        there can still be traces of powder visible when the painting is dry and it’s more challenging to thoroughly blend and control the 
                        dissolve, unlike water color. Since cocoa dissolve can produce only one color, in order to create some shadow or dimensions to the 
                        picture, the painter will have to lighten the dissolve’s color by adding more water. </p>
                    <h3>Why cocoa paint?</h3>
                        <p>Since cocoa powder is common to a regular household pantry, it’s easy to get started. Painting with a singular color like cocoa 
                            dissolve helps the painter feel less intimidated compared to watercolor painting, which has many different colors and can be 
                            overwhelming. It allows them to be creative about what to paint and how to make more depth to the artwork with just one color. 
                            It trains them to have problem-solving skills when they accidentally mess up their artwork and want to fix or twist it. 
                            It’s also a sustainable and more eco-friendly option than a traditional watercolor that is packed in tubes and might 
                            contain chemicals. While waiting for the color to dry before continuing to paint, it’s a chance to practice patience. 
                            Above all, it’s an opportunity to take a break and relieve stress from work. </p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Cocoa powder can be purchased at any grocery store or a local business that sells the product in bulk. 
                            Paper and brushes for painting are available at a stationary store or e-commerce store.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately there is no decent video tutorial about cocoa powder painting. However, this one coffee <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtC-QmqaApw" target="_blank">painting video</a> for beginners 
                        helps so much as coffee and cocoa powder painting are very similar.
